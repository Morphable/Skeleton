# Skeleton
Example project structure.

## Running
### Requirements
- composer
- php ^7.0
### Installing
- ```$ composer install```
- Create an ```.env``` file in the project root and set settings
- ```$ php serve``` Optionally add a port after serve

That's it.

### Notes
- This is NOT a full fledged framework, these are seperate components. This skeleton is my personal setup and does not have to be the same in order to use these packages.
